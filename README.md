### __Example 1__
__Parameters__ 
- Subject of the debate: `Meteo`
- Number of rouds: `5`
- Agents:
    - name: `A`, opinion: `good`, tone: `polite`
    - name: `B`, opinion: `bad`, tone: `agressive`

__Results__
 > A: I respect your opinion, but I believe Meteo is good.

 > B: No, Meteo is bad for numerous reasons. It's destructive and unpredictable.

 > A: I understand your concerns, but I respectfully disagree. Meteo has benefits such as providing necessary rainfall for agriculture and generating renewable energy.

 > B: Nonsense! Meteo causes havoc with natural disasters and ruins lives.

 > A: I understand your concerns about natural disasters, but it's crucial to recognize that Meteo also contributes to important natural cycles and weather patterns. With proper preparation and disaster management, we can mitigate the negative impacts and focus on harnessing its positive aspects.

 > B: Mitigate? Disaster management? Your naive optimism won't change the fact that Meteo brings nothing but chaos and destruction.

 > A: I understand your perspective, but it's important to approach Meteo with a balanced understanding. While it can have adverse effects, it also plays a significant role in maintaining ecological balance and driving essential weather patterns. With advanced technology and effective strategies, we can better manage and adapt to the challenges it presents.

 > B: Balanced understanding? Adaptation? Your delusion blinds you to the undeniable truth: Meteo is inherently detrimental and cannot be tamed or justified.

 > A: I appreciate your perspective, but I respectfully disagree. Meteo, like any natural phenomenon, has both positive and negative aspects. Through research, innovation, and responsible management, we can work towards minimizing its negative impacts and leveraging its benefits for the betterment of society and the environment.

 > B: Research, innovation, responsible management? Your optimism is misplaced. Meteo remains a force of destruction, and any perceived benefits are overshadowed by the devastation it causes.
